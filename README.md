Railway-Reservation-Management-System:
The Railway Reservation System is similar to IRCTC - the current railway reservation system in India. The project was made using MySQL as a part of SQL Project. The Railway Reservation System is a simplified database solution designed for managing train reservations. It provides passengers with essential information such as train schedules, seat availability and ticket booking status. The system uses mySQL to store and manage data about trains, passengers and tickets.

How to Run the Project:
Tools Required: MySQL Workbench

Features: 
Manage records for trains, passengers, and tickets.
Retrieve train information based on source and destination.
Track train status, including seat availability and reservation status.
Support for Premium and General ticket categories.
Handle waitlist reservations when tickets are full.
Execute SQL queries for retrieving and filtering data based on user-defined criteria.

ER Diagram:
An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships to each other, typically used in computing regarding the organization of data within databases or information systems. In the context of a railway reservation system, an ER diagram would illustrate the various entities involved in the system, such as passengers, tickets, trains, and bookings, and show how these entities interact with each other.
The system uses an ER diagram to model the relationships between Train, Passenger and Ticket entities. Six tables are created in MySQL.
